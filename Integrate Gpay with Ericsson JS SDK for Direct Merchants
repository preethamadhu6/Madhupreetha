# Sandbox and Test Account Setup

## Prerequisites
- A **sandbox merchant account** that supports Google Pay.  
- Access to the **Ericsson Payments Console** (or equivalent PSP dashboard).  

## Steps
1. Log in to the **Ericsson Payments Console / PSP Dashboard**.  
2. Navigate to **Apps & Credentials**.  
3. Ensure that the environment is **Sandbox**.  
4. Select or create an application.  
5. Under **Features**, enable **Google Pay** and save.  

> If Google Pay is disabled, complete sandbox onboarding with your PSP or Ericsson Payments team.  
> For production use, follow the Ericsson **Go-Live checklist** (PCI, SCA, domain verification, and acquirer whitelisting).

# Test Environment Setup

Before development, complete the following:  

- Create a **sandbox merchant account**.  
- Obtain **merchant ID / client ID**.  
- Create **sandbox users/test cards** as required by the PSP.

# Integration Steps

## Server API (Orders Flow)

Server endpoints must be implemented to connect with the **Ericsson Payments API** or your PSP’s Orders API:

- **Create Order**  
- **Authorize Payment** (if auth/capture flow is required)  
- **Capture Payment**  

### Example: Node.js (Express)

```code
// server.js
import express from "express";
import * as EricssonPay from "./ericsson-payments.js"; // Placeholder SDK
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

/* Create Order */
app.post("/api/orders", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const order = await EricssonPay.createOrder({
      amount: req.body.amount,
      currency: req.body.currency,
    });
    res.json(order);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Create order failed:", e);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "CREATE_ORDER_FAILED" });
  }
});

/* Capture Payment */
app.post("/api/orders/:orderID/capture", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { orderID } = req.params;
    const captureData = await EricssonPay.capturePayment(orderID);
    res.json(captureData);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Capture failed:", e);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "CAPTURE_FAILED" });
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server listening on port 3000"));
```
# Conclusion

The Google Pay integration provides Ericsson merchants with a secure and streamlined checkout option that improves the customer experience and reduces cart abandonment.  

By following the steps in this guide—setting up sandbox accounts, configuring the test environment, implementing server-side APIs, and enabling the Google Pay button on the client side—you can ensure a reliable integration aligned with Ericsson’s payment standards.  

Key benefits of this integration include:
